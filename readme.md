Typing Game beta version

This game was written in Javascript, with a helping hand from the jQuery and SoundManager libraries. 

The current version works on the latest Chrome browser, but has yet to be tested on other browsers.

Approach:
This game randomly generates paragraphs of text that the user is to then type out as quickly as possible. There are two difficulties at the moment; easy and hard. The easy setting utilized a real text lorem ipsum generator, whereas the hard setting pulled passages from classic literature. The paragraphs in the hard setting are longer and use more punctuation.

The logic to review the user's input against the random paragraphs still needs to be tweaked. It works at the moment, but so does keyboard mashing. This can be fixed by a simple logical statement most likely.

Use:
Use this game to test your typing speed! It currently generates words per minute and total time until completion. Future iterations will also have accuracy reports.
